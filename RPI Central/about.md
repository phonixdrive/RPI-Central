# About This Site

RPI Central is an iOS app built to streamline student life at RPI. The core feature is a calendar system tailored to RPIâ€™s academic schedule, with support for organizing classes and events in a structured way. Additional functionality includes a meal swipe tracker, and the app is designed to serve as a foundation for integrating more campus utilities over time. It is intended as a central hub for student-related tools rather than a single-purpose app.
