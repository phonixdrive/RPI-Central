Crucial to the goals of this course is to encourage students to pursue and develop their own unique vision and voice in architecture throughout their education and practice. Fundamental to this process is making students aware of the necessity to challenge their own subjectivities, biases, and presuppositions.",

Students will develop the ability to design architecture that, through material selection, form, orientation and climate-specific strategies, mitigates its impacts on the climate and the ecosystem. Environmental and Ecological Systems will introduce analysis and simulation tools which put the environmental principles covered in course lectures into practice. Projects will run in coordination with design projects in ARCH 2830 and will explore site-specific climate analysis, the deployment of environmental strategies at multiple scales, and the design of daylighting and shading strategies informed by digital simulations and physical models.",

Design experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. These experiments take the form of digital simulations and constructed scale models, with student documentation and reflection on their design processes.

As such, it endeavors to examine critically the disciplinary boundary between building, and site planning, accessibility, parking and landscape topography. It also critically assesses the connections and inherent complexities between an institutional situation and workplace activity, in order to explore questions of public and private. This studio also addresses the tectonic dimensions of construction and structure in architectural design.",

      "description": "Architecture and painting are two of the oldest forms of societal expression and have been historically linked in complex and dynamic ways. In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.",

An essential part of this course is to stimulate students' curiosity about architecture and the larger world and introduce them to key issues of architecture regarding space, form, critique, technology, aesthetics, societal and cultural contexts, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to the emergence of modernism in architecture. Crucial to the goals of this course is to encourage students to pursue and develop their own unique vision and voice in architecture throughout their education and practice. Fundamental to this process is making students aware of the necessity to challenge their own subjectivities, biases, and presuppositions.",

A Professional Project often serves as a culminating experience for a Professional Master\u2019s program but, with departmental or school approval, can be used to fulfill other program requirements. With approval, students may register for more than one Professional Project. Professional Projects must result in documentation established by each department or school, but are not submitted to the Office of Graduate Education and are not archived in the library. Grades of A, B, C, or F are assigned by the faculty adviser at the end of the semester. If not completed on time, a formal Incomplete grade may be assigned by the faculty adviser, listing the work remaining to be completed and the time limit for completing this work.",

Sullivan)  These perceptions originate from a consistent verbal and visual story communicated through a multitude of media platforms. In this class, we'll define the brand story, create messaging, and design the logo, stationery, signage, packaging, advertising, schwag, motion graphics, etc. The course culminates with the design of an identity standards manual defining the rules and principles to effectively communicate a consistent brand image.",

The course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of statistical time series analysis. Topics covered include stationary and non-stationary stochastic processes, autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models, model selection and estimation, state-space models and the Kalman filter, forecasting and forecast evaluation,  an outline of spectral techniques. While these fundamental techniques are remarkably successful, availability of large time series data sets motivates application of AI/ML methods. Thus we will cover various deep neural networks that are relevant to time series data including RNN, LSTM.",

To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions. Overall, the course will provide the student with an encompassing view of how economic principles and concepts relate to the broader economy and society.",

      "description": "This course describes how individuals and firms make financial decisions, and how those decisions might deviate from those predicted by traditional financial or economic theory. The course examines how the insights of behavioral economics complement the traditional finance paradigm by introducing some of the main psychological biases in financial decision-making and examining the impacts of these biases in financial markets and other financial settings. It will also introduce students to behavioral and experimental methodologies in finance, economics, and other disciplines.",

Who makes such policies and how are they implemented? Do data policies look the same all over the world? What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy?

In this course, students will explore these society/environment interactions at various levels, from the local to the global, using the concepts and insights of environmental sociology. Environmental sociologists aim to understand the social origins of environmental problems and propose workable solutions to them. By showing how social interaction, institutions, and beliefs shape human behavior, environmental sociology provides a useful complement to the natural sciences in the analysis of the environmental problems faced today.",

But recursive loops in which things govern themselves are also foundational to society. Indigenous societies are renowned for their ecological self-stabilization. Wikipedia, Open Sources Software, and other means of \"crowdsourcing\" offer new visions for a more democratic civil society.",
